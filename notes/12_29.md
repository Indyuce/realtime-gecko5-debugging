## Work Done


### memory alignment

openOCD never performs unaligned 32 bit reads. see report (under "Evaluation" for more info)

openOCD performs one of these three:
- 1-byte aligned  8-bit  read  (byte)
- 2-byte aligned 16-bits reads (half word)
- 4-byte aligned 32-bit read   (full word)

4 bytes at address 0x401 is interpreted as three distinct reads


### unaligned reads

when outputing `byte_enable` as memory read:
this confirms the masks used by openOCD. seem to work fine on VP directly.
```
(gdb) x/wx 0x401
0x401 <__divdi3+1025>:  0x04000308
```

so

```
0x04 | 0100 | 1-byte    read
0x03 | 0011 | half word read
0x08 | 1000 | 1-byte    read
```


### uploading a program

disable CRC checks in OpenOCD to check upload performance

```
(gdb) load
Loading section .vectors, size 0x184 lma 0x0
Loading section .text, size 0x200c lma 0x184
Loading section .rodata, size 0x16c lma 0x2190
Loading section .eh_frame, size 0x54 lma 0x22fc
Start address 0x00000100, load size 9040
Transfer rate: 420 KB/sec, 2260 bytes/write.
```

420kb/sec with 4mhz JTAG.


### problem with writes

Writes still suffer from the TDI input line problem. the toplevel module passes the TDI input line further down to submodules, notably wishbone->CRC. the TDI line is used to compute CRC so it will be erroneous if it takes into the first NULL bit.

also, the TDI line might be used to populate the `data_in_reg`, that would explain the CRC errors gotten.

fortunately testbenches do replicate this issue.
