# Meeting notes

different wishbone implementations. find and download specs it online

find openocd docs where to tell openOCD to use the chain 0x32 on the debug controler
either one of the two user custom instructions 0x32 and 0x37
where to put that in openOCD config files???

worst case use telnet at the beginning for very basic scans as one can do irscans manually

once dummy debug controler is done, implement wishbone module first, as it is required to upload programs.
understand what the jsp server does (fourth and last module of adv_debug_if)
