# Meeting Notes

do not latch the busy bit otherwise writes will be 1 cycle.

gdb might use a smaller word size, perform unaligned memory reads that sdram controler rejects

register file

both B ports are for reading

two write ports for the two operands





for registers : duplicate the dualport memory and duplicate the write signals.
then i have two additional write ports to read from

## Work Done

### openOCD looping forever

openOCD loops forever due to small code bug, variable declared after goto reset everytime a bus error occurs, so openOCD never times out in case of bus error. openOCD will now only try again up to 3 times with a bus error, and it will eventually give up.

### writes

fix writes. the rdy bit used to be Z which would be misinterpreted as a bus error

### report

report is ready
