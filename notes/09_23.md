# Meeting Notes

not using openocd is a problem, cant assume if it works but or1ksim that it is going to work with openOCD

think about stripping down openOCD to only contain functionalities for gecko5education.

DDD quite nice graphical interface, it is cross platform ? openOCD for sure is.

maybe there's a plugin for VS Code that does that. specifically for GDB. likely that there's one already

START WITH dummy debug controler that answers dummy values. dummy state machine for memory reads for instance

GDB for or1200 should work fine decompiling or1300 instructions.


TODO

1/ 
get the setup for last semester project running with GDB. last years student used a CLI to send instructions to the JTAG interface, now needs to use GDB.
- try and understand the way openOCD transforms GDB commands into JTAG commands

another possibility: "rewriting" openOCD to understand GDB protocol and translate it into JTAG

GDB is absolutely given 


- last years semester project setup working
- compare the packets when using GDB vs telnet. hopefully some of the work can be done only using the ipcore and memory access
- moving to gdb
- write a dummy debug controler

dummy controler that supports a very barebones software

length of two chains // length of data register should be hardcoded in openOCD driver directly. usually stored in """BSD files""" ???

---------------

convert_32 program takes in the .elf file and generates the CMEM file.
CMEM file contains read-only and read-write sections writen in ACSII, because of limitation of the serial connection

utility would not be needed anymore if we move to JTAG for uploading files.

---------------

2/ look for frontend alternative (DDD) ? maybe one for vs code.
