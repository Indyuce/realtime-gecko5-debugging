# Meeting Notes

would make sense to have only 1 word transactions on the biu.
jtag is much slower than the system bus

# Work Done

## single word rw's for BIU

Yes, the BIU only does single word bus transactions.
system is much faster than the JTAG clock.

if openOCD reads 32 bits, it needs 32 JTAG clocks.
JTAG ~ 4Mhz, system ~80Mhz so 20 times faster.
openOCD takes ~600 system cycles to transfer
