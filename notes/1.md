General semester project info

- Remind to ask about last semester project of last student
- Midterm presentation, email about that. MOSTLY FOR 
- Final presentation, week before exam in JANUARY. Needs to be everything of work. Repeat everything in midterm if needed. Nt incremental 
- Report 1 week before final persentaton
- Maybe one meeting every 2 weeks
- Incrementally build documentation for project

Technical

Joined Test Action Group = hardware component inside FPGA. 4 wires, serial protocol
Jtag is hardware component. Already implemented in the FPGA.
Four wires. TCI TCK TDO CC then two registers then FSM
Openrisc.io DEBUGGING WITH OPENOCD AND GDB
Or1200 processors already have a debug interface. Maybe look into that ( DEBUG CONTROLLER ) and take inspiration from that 

TODO

- Learn about openocd-gdb protocols and commands
- Learn about JTAG 4 signals
- Make a planning for the project.

TODO long term

- Look for information to simulate the jtag interface on software for openOCD. Looking for software simulation ( if exists) OF JTAG INTERFACE. maybe look in the openocd documentation. Maybe simulator exists for OR1200 and signals would be somewhat similar, basically a VP coded in C
- When diving in openOCD, whats the difference with RISC because in the future the VP will be a RISC5 virtual prototype
