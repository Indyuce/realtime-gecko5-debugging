# Meeting Notes

way to fix 1 cycle delay. MSB needs to be ignored and use TDI for the LSB.

{  shiftreg[:-1] : TDI } instead of {  shiftreg[:] }

## Problem: `debug_select_i` goes off sometimes

I said last week that `debug_select_i` was only needed when in shift/Capture state. not true
top level debug controler checks the signal when UPDATING module ID register after getting a module select command.

verilog code
```verilog
assign select_cmd = input_shift_reg[52];
assign module_id_in = input_shift_reg[51:50];

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Module select register and select signals

always @ (posedge tck_i or posedge rst_i)
begin
  if (rst_i)
    module_id_reg <= 2'b0;
  else if(debug_select_i && select_cmd && update_dr_i && !select_inhibit)       // Chain select
    module_id_reg <= module_id_in;
end
```

need to patch up that signal so that it stays on for as long as needed. no real solution as of right now because no access to the internal signals of the TAP controler. no way to detect when a change in the IR occurs.
